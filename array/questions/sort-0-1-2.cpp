// APPROACH: OPTIMAL 
// DIFFICULTY: MEDIUM
// TECHNIQUE: DUTCH NATIONAL FLAG ALGO
// TIME COMPLEXITY: O(N) , SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(1)
// NOTE: Take extra care of which pointer to move at what time
// COMMENT: if swaping from back, that mean replacing by known so we can move mid ptr forward, but 
// when swapping from back, we are bringing unknown to mid, so we can move forward mid.


// 0-> low-1 (0's) low->mid-1 (1's)  mid->high unsorted elements, high+1->n-1 (2's)
